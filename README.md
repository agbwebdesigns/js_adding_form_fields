# js_adding_form_fields
A Javascript program that adds functionality to a form.

All of the form-fields are attached to a datecode that is entered at the top of the form.  If a user wants to add another datecode, they can.  It will populate more form-fields attached to the new datecode.  There are also checkboxes near the top of the form the will omit form-fields from being printed.  I added all of this functionality to the form that was created by my client.

Added functionality:
add datecodes to each section of the form,
add multiple datecodes,
add new sections for each new datecode,
add functionality to checkboxes to omit individual sections from printing

I created the datecode.js file to add functionality to the detailed.html program. I took HTML markup out of the detailed.html file and placed it into the temp folder.  Then I added this HTML markup be loaded via Javascript in the datecode.js file.  There it can be loaded dynamically back into the detailed.html file as needed.  I'm uploading the whole program at this time to give better context to my work.
